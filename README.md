SImple alert system that alerts the player of curses / debuffs / Diseases / poisons / Magic / Enrage. comes with a little ingame panel to toggle on and off what you don't want. Use it, don't use it, idgaf this is mainly for me because im dumb 

Pure spaghetti code, not gonnna fit it anytime soon either lol

1. Download the latest release

2. Unzip folder with WINRAR or 7ZIP or whatever you use

3. go to your WOW Classic addons folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft_anniversary\_\Interface)

4. Place the unzipped folder "syn_alerts" inside the addons folder

5. load into wow and you're good to go!

If you want to turn off some features you can simply type "/sa config" in the ingame chat and then untick what you don't want!
